## Adapter

Used to transform the interface of one class to the interface of another class (which the clients expect).

_By functioning - can be compared to the power electricity adapter_

### Use Cases

  but its interface is not compatible with business logic
* we need to use existing class alongside with other classes, 
  and their interfaces are different
